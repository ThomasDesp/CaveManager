# CaveManager
Final application for the end of the developer .NET formation at HumanBooster.
We had to develop an api for a future fictional wine cellar management application. Here is the context: 
The wine cellar management application is intended to be used by wine adorers to allow them to locate each wine bottles in their cellar and not to forget them.
The user will be able to manage his differents cellars, drawers and bottles of wine.
It also has a function to know when to taste his wines.
